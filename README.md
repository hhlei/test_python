# test_python

Just messing around with CI pipeline using github actions. Wrote quick fizzbuzz script with some tests. Created github action to automatically run tests when pushed to remote repo.

To start a game:
1. navigate to package root
2. python -m fizzbuzz.fizzbuzz

To run tests manually:
1. navigate to package root
2. python -m pytest tests
